			<p>So close no matter how far<br>
			Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
			Forever trusting who we are<br>
			And nothing else matters</p>
			<p>Never opened myself this way<br>
			Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
			All these words I don't just say<br>
			And nothing else matters</p>
			<p>Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
			Every day for us something new<br>
			Open mind for a different view<br>
			And nothing else matters</p>
			<p>Never cared for what they do<br>
			Never cared for what they know<br>
			But I know</p>
